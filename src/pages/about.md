      Hi! I’m Skye, the face behind slow stitch club.\

      \

      After studying fashion design at university, I graduated with a very different view of the industry, and wanted to push against it. From that point on I continued to learn and educate myself; about the vast quantities of clothing that is sent to landfill, the devastating environmental impacts of textiles production as well as the horrifying truths about garment workers and their lack of rights.


      The importance of caring for and extending the lives of the clothes that already exist in the world became hugely important to me, and I set out to help teach and educate others about learning to fix their clothing through the practice of visible mending.


      Mending is a hugely creative and intentionally slow and therapeutic skill, and the community surrounding it is super inspiring. I hope you’ll join us to learn a new skill and be a part of the change to fight against fast fashion whilst taking care of the clothes you love.


      I love talking all things visible mending so if you want to chat or have any questions please email me at skye@slowstitch.club. I’m also on the lookout for stockists so if you’d like any of my products in your store, or want to host mending workshops get in touch.

      ## Mending not for you?


      If you love the look of visible mending but aren’t able to try it for yourself, I also offer a visible mending service.


      Email me with photos and a description of your clothing and the damage that needs mending.


      We can then talk through options for mending and I can work out a quote and time frame for you.
