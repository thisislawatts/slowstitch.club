      ## Mending not for you?


      If you love the look of visible mending but arenâ€™t able to try it for yourself, I also offer a visible mending service.


      From broken belt loops and rips in denim, to holey socks and bleach stains, [e**mail me**](mailto:skye@slowstitch.club) with photos and a description of your clothing and the damage that needs mending.


      We can then talk through options for mending and I can work out a quote and time frame for you.
