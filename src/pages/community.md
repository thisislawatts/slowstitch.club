      I’ve found the world of visible mending to be an amazing hub for creative
      folk all around the world, and the sense of community that I have gained
      since starting slow stitch club has been amazing. 


      Below are handful of stitchers and makers that continue to inspire me and enrich the mending community. 


      **Renee - [@thatperfecthour](https://www.instagram.com/thatperfecthour/)** \

      Renee and I spent so much time chatting to each other from other sides of the world about mending that we now have chats on IG Live! Join us fortnightly for our “It’s not about the socks” series.

      **Eleysha - [@beyondrepair519](https://www.instagram.com/beyondrepair519/)**\

      Eleysha is the creator of the awesome Swift Darner; a reinvention of the Speedweve that is sustainably made by her. Her talents know no bounds and it’s so exciting to see an antique mending tool being recreated in today's world.

      **Kirsty - [@spiderweavestudio](https://www.instagram.com/spiderweavestudio/)**\

      Kirsty is a meticulous mender and a wonderful friend too. Her attention to detail is impeccable and her love of mending shines through all of her work. 


      **Keiko & Atsushi - [@sashikostory](https://www.instagram.com/sashikostory/)**\

      I have spent (and still spend) a lot of time reading about Sashiko. It’s a hugely immersive and ancient practice, and I think it’s really important to learn from those whose culture it is a part of. Keiko and Atsushi put so much effort into educating others on top of sharing their incredible work.


      **Miranda - [@littlelemonloom](https://www.instagram.com/littlelemonloom/)**\

      Miranda is another innovative maker who has created another Speedweve alternative - and a way for you to make your own! 


      **Selina - [@selinaam05](https://www.instagram.com/selinaam05/)**\

      I absolutely love Selina’s work and find it so inspiring to scroll through her Instagram feed. Beautiful and intricate mends that are always sympathetic to the clothing as well as the techniques she uses. 


      **Eva [@evakittelsen](https://www.instagram.com/evakittelsen/)**\

      Owner of My Visible Mend, Eva’s shop is a treasure trove of mending equipment, and I always love to read her posts and learn from her. 


      **Bryony - [@tickover](https://www.instagram.com/tickover/)**\

      Bryony is an immensely talented embroiderer and anti fast fashion advocate. Her work is so important and informative in support of garment workers and the planet and I am so happy to see her shout about the causes that need attention in a medium that is so impactful.
